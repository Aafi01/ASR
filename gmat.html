  <p>The Graduate Management Admission Test is a computer adaptive test (CAT) intended to assess certain analytical, writing, quantitative, verbal, and reading skills in written English for use in admission to a graduate management program, such as an MBA. It requires knowledge of certain specific grammar and knowledge of certain specific algebra, geometry, and arithmetic. According to the test owning company, the Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC), the GMAT assesses analytical writing and problem-solving abilities, while also addressing data sufficiency, logic, and critical reasoning skills that it believes to be vital to real-world business and management success. It can be taken up to five times a year. Attempts must be at least 16 days apart.</p>
  <p>GMAT is a registered trademark of the Graduate Management Admission Council. More than 7,000 programs at approximately 2,300 graduate business schools around the world accept the GMAT as part of the selection criteria for their programs. Business schools use the test as a criterion for admission into a wide range of graduate management programs, including MBA, Master of Accountancy, Master of Finance programs and others. The GMAT is administered in standardized test centers in 114 countries around the world.

  <hr>
  <p>
    GMAC® the conducting authority of GMAT® does not specify any GMAT 2018 eligibility criteria. Therefore, anyone who is aspiring to appear in the GMAT 2018 test does not have to fulfil any particular GMAT eligibility criteria 2018. However, as the GMAT score is utilised by the institutes for their admission process of Masters or Post Graduate programs, test takers are typically required to have an undergraduate degree to cross further rounds of the selection process set up by the respective colleges/universities they wish to apply to. Since the eligibility criteria of GMAT 2018 is unstipulated, the criteria for eligibility pertaining to admission is set by individual business schools which also includes GMAT score.

    The content on the GMAT is broken down into four scored test sections, two of which are scored separately, and two of which are scored separately but are also combined to generate your composite score:
    <ul>
      <li>Analytical Writing Assessment</li>
      <li>Integrated Reasoning</li>
      <li>Quantitative</li>
      <li>Verbal</li>
    </ul>
